# ngx-react

This simple Angular library integrates React components into Angular applications with ease. It is based on React [createElement](https://react.dev/reference/react/createElement) function and Angular [directives](https://angular.io/guide/attribute-directives). See source code [here](./projects/ngx-react/src/lib/directives/react-component.directive.ts)
